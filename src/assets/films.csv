In Love Witch, she's writing and perfoming the music, designing and sewing the costumes. If you see a painting in a scene, she made it. The homage to technicolor is right on the money. I like to be challenged and our senses of humor are too similar, so I dinged it half a point. But Biller is GOAT 1000/10","","","","",""
